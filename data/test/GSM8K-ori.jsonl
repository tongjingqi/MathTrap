{"category": "GSM8K", "question": "Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 34. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?", "answer": "Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.\nCombining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120\nDividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20\nSubstituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96\n#### 96"}

How many peaches did she put in the knapsack?", "answer": "5 dozen peaches is 5*12=<<5*12=60>>60 peaches.\nLet \"x\" be the number of peaches put into the knapsack.\nThus, the total number of peaches is x+(2*x)+(2*x)=60.\nSimplifying the expression, we see that 5*x=60.\nDividing each side of the equation by 5, we see that x=12 peaches,\n#### 12"}

Peter bought 2 pairs of pants and 5 shirts for 2*X + 5 shirts * $10/shirt = $62.\nSubtracting $50 from both sides, we get 2*X = $12.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get X = $6.\n#### 6"}
